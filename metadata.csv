Coronal and axial chest CT images show confluent mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidative lesions in peripheral bilateral lungs. Discrete patchy consolidation (arrowheads) is noted in left upper lobe. Most of lesions spare juxtapleural area, and minor proportion of lesions touch pleura. Lesions contain multiple air-bronchograms, and air-bronchogram in superior segment of right lower lobe is distorted (arrows)."

Baseline anteroposterior chest radiograph shows patchy ground-glass opacities in right upper and lower lung zones and patchy consolidation in left middle to lower lung zones. Several calcified granulomas are incidentally noted in left upper lung zone.
